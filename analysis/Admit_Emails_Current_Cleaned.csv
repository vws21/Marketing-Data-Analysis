I’m Emily Bennett, the school’s Manager of Experiential Learning. In short, I connect SCI students to outside of the classroom learning opportunities. This may involve internships, co-ops, research, or community engagement. Whether you’re growing your current skillset or branching into something new, professional development and resume building is always beneficial. Here’s how SCI can help: 

    iServe: this program pairs you with a local non-profit for a semester long service project. You’ll help them with technical, computing or information related issues, which gives you more resume experience and recent professional references. It’s also a highly rewarding experience. 

    Community Engagement Centers: a commitment Pitt made to the local community, these can get you involved by teaching digital literacy, cybersecurity, coding, and other topics.  

    Alternative Spring Break: you can travel to a country like Ecuador for a service-learning project with global impact. 

    Practical industry experience: internships or co-ops are a great way to learn on the job. SCI brings in employers to host information sessions, organizes professional workshops, and more.  

Find us when you arrive to make the most of your Pitt experience!  

I look forward to meeting you soon.
