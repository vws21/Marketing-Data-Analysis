I’m so pleased you’re interested in graduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Computing and Information! As the Manager of Experiential Learning, my job is to help students build skills and make an impact outside their classroom.  As you explore graduate programs, take a moment to explore some SCI experiential learning. There’s something for everyone: 

    iServe: This pairs students with non-profit organizations for a semester-long project. While it’s great for your resume, it’s also a highly rewarding experience that makes a difference in the Pittsburgh community. 

    Community Engagement Centers: Go out in the Pittsburgh community, where you can teach digital literacy, cybersecurity, coding, and other topics. 

    Alternative Spring Break: Make a global impact! SCI has brought students to Ecuador for over 7 years where they lead technical, skills-based service projects and benefit a community. 

    Internships and co-ops: It’s always a great option to learn on the job, but there are many other ways to engage with employers through sessions, workshops, and more. 

Even though graduate school will be more focused and rigorous than your undergraduate studies, I can assure you that using your skills in applied settings is even more important!

I’m so pleased you’re interested in graduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Computing and Information! As the Manager of Experiential Learning, my job is to help students build skills and make an impact outside their classroom.  As you explore graduate programs, take a moment to explore some SCI experiential learning. There’s something for everyone: 

    iServe: This pairs students with non-profit organizations for a semester-long project. While it’s great for your resume, it’s also a highly rewarding experience that makes a difference in the Pittsburgh community. 

    Community Engagement Centers: Go out in the Pittsburgh community, where you can teach digital literacy, cybersecurity, coding, and other topics. 

    Alternative Spring Break: Make a global impact! SCI has brought students to Ecuador for over 7 years where they lead technical, skills-based service projects and benefit a community. 

    Internships and co-ops: It’s always a great option to learn on the job, but there are many other ways to engage with employers through sessions, workshops, and more. 

Even though graduate school will be more focused and rigorous than your undergraduate studies, I can assure you that using your skills in applied settings is even more important!   

Best of luck in your search for a graduate program! Please don’t hesitate to contact the SCI Student Services team if you have any questions!

    Community Engagement Centers: Go out in the Pittsburgh community, where you can teach digital literacy, cybersecurity, coding, and other topics. 

    Alternative Spring Break: Make a global impact! SCI has brought students to Ecuador for over 7 years where they lead technical, skills-based service projects and benefit a community. 

    Internships and co-ops: It’s always a great option to learn on the job, but there are many other ways to engage with employers through sessions, workshops, and more. 

Even though graduate school will be more focused and rigorous than your undergraduate studies, I can assure you that using your skills in applied settings is even more important!  

Best of luck in your search for a graduate program! Please don’t hesitate to contact the SCI Student Services team if you have any questions.
